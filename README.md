This is the dataset of master thesis - What’s so funny? Testing Chinese humor knowledge of Qwen, Llama3 and Llama3.1.

Abstract
This thesis investigates the humor comprehension capabilities of three state-of-the-art open-resource large language models (LLMs) — Qwen, Llama3, and Llama3.1 — in the context of Chinese humor. Using a dataset of Chinese jokes, the study evaluates how these models, trained in different languages, perform in humor classification tasks,focusing on identifying the mechanisms behind humor (how it is funny) and the reasons for it (why it is funny). The research assesses whether the models’ classifications align with human annotations and analyzes the accuracy of their explanations for the jokes. This study aims to establish a new universal classification system for jokes and provide insights into the current understanding of Chinese humor and broader world comprehension by LLMs.
